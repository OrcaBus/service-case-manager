Service Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Name & responsibility

### Description

### API Endpoints

This service provides a RESTful API following OpenAPI conventions.
The Swagger documentation of the production endpoint is available here:

Development:

<https://case.dev.umccr.org/schema/swagger-ui/>

### Consumed Events

| Name / DetailType | Source         | Schema Link       | Description         |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| _None currently_ | _N/A_ | _N/A_ | _The Case Manager service does not currently consume external events_ |

### Published Events

| Name / DetailType | Source         | Schema Link       | Description         |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `CaseExternalEntityRelationshipStateChange` | `orcabus.casemanager` | [schema](./case-manager/app/schemas/events/case_external_entity_relationship_created.json) | Announces when relationship between the case and external entity changes |


### (Internal) Data states & persistence model

### Major Business Rules

### Permissions & Access Control

### Change Management

#### Versioning strategy

E.g. Manual tagging of git commits following Semantic Versioning (semver) guidelines.

#### Release management

The service employs a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and releases all changes to the `main` code branch.


Infrastructure & Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short description with diagrams where appropriate.
Deployment settings / configuration (e.g. CodePipeline(s) / automated builds).

Infrastructure and deployment are managed via CDK.


### Stateless
- Lambdas
- StepFunctions


### CDK Commands

You can access CDK commands using the `pnpm` wrapper script.

- **`cdk-stateless`**: Used to deploy stacks containing stateless resources (e.g., AWS Lambda), which can be easily redeployed without side effects.

The type of stack to deploy is determined by the context set in the `./bin/deploy.ts` file. This ensures the correct stack is executed based on the provided context.

For example:

```sh
# Deploy a stateless stack
pnpm cdk-stateless <command>

```

### Stacks

This CDK project manages multiple stacks. The root stack (the only one that does not include `DeploymentPipeline` in its stack ID) is deployed in the toolchain account and sets up a CodePipeline for cross-environment deployments to `beta`, `gamma`, and `prod`.

To list all available stacks, run:

```sh
pnpm cdk-stateless ls
```

Example output:

```sh
OrcaBusStatelessCaseManagerStack
OrcaBusStatelessCaseManagerStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusBeta/CaseManagerStack (OrcaBusBeta-CaseManagerStack)
OrcaBusStatelessCaseManagerStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusGamma/CaseManagerStack (OrcaBusGamma-CaseManagerStack)
OrcaBusStatelessCaseManagerStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusProd/CaseManagerStack (OrcaBusProd-CaseManagerStack)
```


Development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Project Structure

The root of the project is an AWS CDK project where the main application logic lives inside the `./app` folder.

The project is organized into the following key directories:

- **`./app`**: Contains the main application logic. You can open the code editor directly in this folder, and the application should run independently.

- **`./bin/deploy.ts`**: Serves as the entry point of the application.

- **`./infrastructure`**: Contains the infrastructure code for the project:
  - **`./infrastructure/toolchain`**: Includes stacks for the stateless and stateful resources deployed in the toolchain account. These stacks primarily set up the CodePipeline for cross-environment deployments.
  - **`./infrastructure/stage`**: Defines the stage stacks for different environments:
    - **`./infrastructure/stage/config.ts`**: Contains environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `beta`, `gamma`, `prod`).
    - **`./infrastructure/stage/stack.ts`**: The CDK stack entry point for provisioning resources required by the application in `./app`.

- **`.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`**: Configures GitHub Actions to run tests for `make check` (linting and code style), tests defined in `./test`, and `make test` for the `./app` directory. Modify this file as needed to ensure the tests are properly configured for your environment.

- **`./test`**: Contains tests for CDK code compliance against `cdk-nag`. You should modify these test files to match the resources defined in the `./infrastructure` folder.


### Setup

#### Requirements

```sh
node --version
v22.9.0

# Update Corepack (if necessary, as per pnpm documentation)
npm install --global corepack@latest

# Enable Corepack to use pnpm
corepack enable pnpm

```

#### Install Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, run:

```sh
make install
```

### Conventions

### Linting & Formatting

Automated checks are enforces via pre-commit hooks, ensuring only checked code is committed. For details consult the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

Manual, on-demand checking is also available via `make` targets (see below). For details consult the `Makefile` in the root of the project.


To run linting and formatting checks on the root project, use:

```sh
make check
```

To automatically fix issues with ESLint and Prettier, run:

```sh
make fix
```

### Testing


Unit tests are available for most of the business logic. Test code is hosted alongside business in `/tests/` directories.

```sh
make test
```
